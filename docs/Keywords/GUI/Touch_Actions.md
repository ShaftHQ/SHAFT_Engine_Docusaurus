#### We can interact with Touch Actions via the following methods: 

### performElementAction():
* We use this method to call the Element Actions within the current Touch Actions instance. For example, in case of trying to tap a text box to type something. In that case we have to perform type(), an element action, within the tap(), the touch action. 
* This method returns a WebDriverElementActions object.

```java
import com.shaft.gui.element.TouchActions;
public class Testing {
    @Test
    public void touchActions(){
        new TouchActions(driver).touchMethod(element locator).performElementAction().touchMethod(element, String "");
    }

    @Test2
    public void touchActions(){
        driver.element().performTouchAction()
                .tap(locator)
                .performElementAction()
                .type(locator, String "")
    }
}
```
### nativeKeyboardKeyPress():
* We use this method to send a keypress via the device soft keyboard. 
* Needed parameters: key - the key that should be pressed.
* This method returns a self-reference to be used to chain actions.

```java
import com.shaft.gui.element.TouchActions;
public class Testing {
    @Test
    public void touchActions(){
        new TouchActions(driver).touchMethod(element locator).nativeKeyboardKeyPress(KeyboardKeys key);
    }
}
```

### hideNativeKeyboard():
* We use this method to hide the device native soft keyboard. 
* This method returns a self-reference to be used to chain actions.

```java
import com.shaft.gui.element.TouchActions;
public class Testing {
    @Test
    public void touchActions(){
        new TouchActions(driver).hideNativeKeyboard();
    }
}
```

    }
}
```

* Needed parameters: zoomDirection - ZoomDirection.IN or OUT.
* This method returns a  self-reference to be used to chain actions.

```java
import com.shaft.gui.element.TouchActions;
public class Testing {
    @Test
    public void touchActions(){
         new TouchActions(driver).pinchToZoom(ZoomDirection zoomDirection);
    }
}
```
