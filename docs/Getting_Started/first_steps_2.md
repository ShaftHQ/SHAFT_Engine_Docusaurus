- SHAFT is built on top of Selenium WebDriver, which means:
  - You can use everything you're already familiar with from the official [Selenium WebDriver user guide].
  - It is fully compatible with [W3C Standards] and [WebDriver BiDi].
  - It is empowered by the largest Test Automation Community in the world.
  - It is backed by the most mature Test Automation Infrastructure.
- SHAFT is highly reliable with built-in test synchronization.
- SHAFT comes with many out of the box built-in features that are 100% configurable (No Magic ðŸª„).
- SHAFT is a coded test automation engine, hence it is highly maintainable, and scalable.
  - You can use SHAFT with the latest `TestNG`, `JUnit5`, or `Cucumber`. 
  - You can use SHAFT to implement the `Page Object Model` Design Pattern, `Fluent Design` or any other pattern you choose.
- SHAFT provides direct access to all underlying APIs, which means:
  - You can easily return a native WebDriver object for Selenium or Appium.
  - You can easily return a Response object for Rest Assured.
  - You have full control over your own code with no forced syntax (No Limitations ðŸ’ª).
