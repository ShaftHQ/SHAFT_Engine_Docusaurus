# SHAFT User Guide

This website is built using [Docusaurus 3](https://docusaurus.io/), a modern static website generator.

### Installation

```shell
yarn install
```

### Local Development

- Start a local server by running this command:
```shell
yarn start
```
- A new browser window will open; most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server.
- Create your own .md files under the `docs` or `blog` directories.
- You can use something like https://dillinger.io/ to help you create the .md file.
- Add your new file to the sidebar if needed by editing this file `/sidebars.js`.


### Deployment

- Just open a PR with your changes, a temp deployment will be created so that you can view your changes live.
- Once you're happy with the output, submit your PR for review.
- Once it is merged, the changes will be automatically deployed to https://shafthq.github.io/
